This tool has the potential to classify cases according to the probability of new victimizations occurring, providing inputs for targeting public policies aimed at combating revictimization and femicide. The proposed model and algorithm aim to contribute to a faster approach in identifying high-risk victims and managing domestic violence cases, which numerically exceed the current service capacity of state protection agencies.",

The initiative integrates the company's internal data with other public and private information sources, focusing on identifying the extent and evolution of ASROs, as well as analyzing the specific territorial dynamics of each criminal group, especially measuring the impact that such groups exert on territorial control and their relationship with the electricity distribution service.",
