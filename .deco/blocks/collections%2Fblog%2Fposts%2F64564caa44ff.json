The event was organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS) and brought together representatives from local governments, academics, and international organizations such as UN-Habitat and the Regional Center for Green Growth and Climate Change to discuss the impacts of climate change and the role of cities in COP30.</p><p>During the meeting, Joana Monteiro, director and co-founder of Leme, took part in the panel “Tools for Local-Level Security Management: The Experience of Rio de Janeiro,” presenting Rio’s approach to municipal public security management and highlighting the use of evidence-based tools to guide more effective policies.</p><p>In her speech, Joana emphasized that strengthening the role of municipalities in public security depends on the integration of different types of prevention, the use of evidence to guide actions, and the local capacity to plan, execute, and monitor policies aimed at reducing violence.</p><p>“These factors strengthen municipalities’ ability to act in a planned and integrated way in violence prevention. This is an essential condition for achieving lasting progress, based on data-driven decisions and coordinated efforts among different agencies,” Joana stressed.</p><p>For Leme, this discussion reinforces the institution’s commitment to developing integrated public policies, contributing to broader dialogue on resilient cities and the creation of data- and evidence-based solutions.</p><p></p>"
