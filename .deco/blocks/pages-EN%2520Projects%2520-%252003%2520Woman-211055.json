This tool has the potential to classify cases according to the likelihood of further victimization, providing inputs to target public policies aimed at preventing revictimization and femicide. The proposed model and algorithm seek to contribute to a faster approach in identifying high-risk victims and managing domestic violence cases, which currently exceed the capacity of the state’s protection agencies.</p>"
