To this end, we will host Professors Chris Blattman and Benjamin Lessing from the University of Chicago, and Carlos Schmidt-Padilla from the University of California—experts on the subject who have conducted field studies for years on the control and criminal governance of such groups in Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador, and the United States.<br><br></p><p>This initiative reflects Leme’s core mission: fostering productive exchanges and connections between academics and decision-makers. With a dynamic and participatory format, the meeting will be invitation-only and will seek to create a collaborative environment for building practical solutions grounded in scientific evidence. Participants will include representatives from public security institutions, Brazilian and foreign researchers, as well as civil society organizations.<br><br></p><p>Access the full program <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19p86VDtM8wlKjAc_4l9xOmwBC-Ez7mZR\">here</a>.</p><p></p>"
