He studies armed conflicts and governance by criminal groups that do not seek formal state power, such as drug cartels, prison gangs, and paramilitary groups. His first book, *Making Peace in Drug Wars* (Cambridge University Press), examines armed conflict between drug cartels and the state in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. His second book, *Criminal Leviathans: How Gangs Govern From Behind Bars* (under contract with Cambridge), argues that mass incarceration and drug repression have fostered parallel criminal governance within prisons and in urban peripheries.
