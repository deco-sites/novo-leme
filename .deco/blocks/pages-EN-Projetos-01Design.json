The initiative involves supporting the design of the Armed Elite Division of the Municipal Guard and the formulation of a municipal security program focused on reducing crime in urban public spaces. It also includes the design of a management system inspired by best practices such as CompStat — a model developed in New York that relies on data to guide actions with a results-oriented focus — and the development of the city’s Municipal Public Safety Plan. This plan consolidates previous guidelines, defines goals and indicators, and establishes mechanisms for citizen participation and accountability for the coming years. Regarding the Armed Division of the Guard, Leme’s work includes support in designing selection processes, training, control mechanisms, and information systems.</p>"
