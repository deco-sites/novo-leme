The visit also included Benjamin Lessing; researchers Alexandre Simões and Moustafa El-Kashlan, from the University of Chicago; and, representing Leme, Isabela Salgado, a researcher at the laboratory, and Ana Paula Pellegrino, an associate researcher.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify\">The visits aimed to understand the local dynamics of criminal group activities and their relationships with young residents in these territories.
